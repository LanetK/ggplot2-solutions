**_Question 1_** How can you translate each of the initial example datasets into the other
form?

I do not have the ec2 dataset. Instead, I'll use the data in tidyverse:
```{r e.9.3.3.1}
table4b
table4b_trans <- table4b %>%
  gather(key = "year", value = "population", `1999`, `2000`)
table4b_trans

table4b_trans %>% 
  spread(key = "year", value = "population")
```

**_Question 2_** How can you convert back and forth between the economics and
economics long datasets built into ggplot2?

```{r e.9.3.3.2}

```
